                    The Holy Bible is one of Dillonâ€™s favorite books. It has helped him find peace and understanding
                    throughout various parts of his life. The book of Ecclesiates is his favorite part of the Bible. He has read it
                    numerous times over the years and has given him wisdom for the past and future to come.
