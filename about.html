    Dillon Thomas is a native of South Carolina and spends a great deal of his time raising his three
    children with his wife outside of Charleston, SC. He has many hobbies that he enjoys when he has spare
    time. Motorcycles are a great passion, both riding them through the country and maintaining or
    modifying them. He recently purchased a Harley Davidson that he has customized to his liking, but he
    dreams of owning a vintage Harley Davidson or an Indian Motorcycle. On that note, Dillon loves all
    things vintage and retro. Video games and music with the vintage feel, especially with the soundtrack,
    have a special appeal to him. He enjoys antique stores as well and likes to find items from the 40’s, 50’s,
    and 60’s.

    <p>Dillon has been passionate about social studies and history from the time he was in elementary
    school. He still enjoys learning new things and experiencing history through video games, movies, and
    documentaries. Dillon enjoys a variety of movies but is partial towards horror or arthouse films. Eternal
    Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a definite favorite of his as it tells the ultimate love story: true love will
    always find a way even when it seems impossible or forgotten. He enjoys horror stories as well, but his
    favorite book is The Holy Bible, especially the book Ecclesiastes. It gives a feel of hope and imparts
    wisdom regarding the meaning of life.

    Dillon is an experienced musician – learning to play the drums at the age of twelve and going on
    to play in many churches as well as several metal bands. He truly has an expansive taste in music
    enjoying everything from rock to praise and worship to metal to the classic oldies to folk and bluegrass.
    He can play just about anything on the drums, but really loves playing metal music the most. He has also
    taught his oldest son to play drums and helped him learn several other instruments as well.
    There is nothing Dillon loves more than his family. When given the option to spend time with
    anyone in the world, he’d love to see his paternal grandmother again because of how much he misses
    her. Within the next ten years Dillon wants to see himself and his family in their own home that he has
    provided for them. He hopes to see the Grand Canyon one day as well and with any luck will take his
    wife on a motorcycle trip to see it along with the other great wonders that the United States has to
    offer.
